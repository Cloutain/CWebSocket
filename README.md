# CWebSocket
CWebSocket is a websocket library for Windows.

It wraps existing support for websockets provided by WinHttp *on Windows 8 and above* with an object oriented interface that is easy to use.

It supports sending and receiving binary and UTF8 messages, graceful closing of websockets, and is safe for concurrent access form multiple threads.

For a simple example illustrating basic usage, see the `Examples` directory.

For documentation, please refer to pertinent `.h` files.
